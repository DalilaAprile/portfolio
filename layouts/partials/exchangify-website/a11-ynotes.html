      sizes, including mobile devices and tablets Text and buttons resize
      appropriately, maintaining readability and usability across all devicesâ€”a
      crucial aspect for our diverse user base.

      <b>High Contrast Ratio:</b> Interactive elements have a contrast ratio of
      3:36, complying with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards
      for larger text and graphics. This ensures that buttons and text are
      easily visible to users with mild visual impairments, enhancing overall
      accessibility.

      <b>Screen Reader Support with Annotations:</b> The website is optimized
      for screen readers, incorporating annotations that define the linear focus
      order. This assists assistive technologies in navigating through forms

      readers.
